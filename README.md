Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool, or TPOT for short, is a Python library for automated machine learning.

TPOT is an open-source library for performing AutoML in Python. It makes use of the popular Scikit-Learn machine learning library for data transforms and machine learning algorithms and uses a Genetic Programming stochastic global search procedure to efficiently discover a top-performing model pipeline for a given datase

TPOT uses a tree-based structure to represent a model pipeline for a predictive modeling problem, including data preparation and modeling algorithms and model hyperparameters.

Let's use T-pot for regression
